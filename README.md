## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is a prototype developed for XYZ Company to create a system for the oil and gas industry. The prototype is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The purpose of the prototype is to demonstrate the basic functionalities of the system in a simplified manner.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The XYZ Company Oil and Gas System Prototype is a 2-step form that collects project information. Step 1 captures the project name, description, client, and contractor. In Step 2, users can upload a CSV file with KP, X, Y, and Z values. If a file is uploaded, the prototype automatically calculates the maximum and minimum values for X, Y, and Z. Alternatively, users can manually input the maximum and minimum values if no file is uploaded.

Once the form is completed, the result page displays all input values from both steps in a table. Users can also download the result as a PDF.
